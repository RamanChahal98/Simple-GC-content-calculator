# Simple-GC-content-calculator

This is a simple python GC content calculator for nucleotide sequences. 

Can be useful in cases such as in PCR experiments, where the GC-content of primers are used to predict their annealing temperature to the template DNA. A higher GC-content level indicates a higher melting temperature.

To use change line 2 to a FASTA nucleotide sequence (txt)
